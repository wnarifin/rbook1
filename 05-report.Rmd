# Reporting results
In this chapter, we will learn how to combine bits and parts of your results into custom-made texts, labels and tables. This will be useful for reporting and summarizing your results for publication, as well as labeling specific axes on your plots. There are a number of ways to achieve this. We will do this by basic functions and packages.

## `cbind` and `data.frame`


## `paste` and `paste0`


## `kable`


## `stargazer`

## Summary
[summary here]

In the next chapter, using a number of additional data sets, we will use the skills learned from all preceding chapters and conduct full exploration of the data, starting from the data description, descriptive statistics, plots and reporting.
