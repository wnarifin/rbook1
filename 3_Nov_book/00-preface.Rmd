# Preface {-}
This is a book on data exploration using R. The focus of this book is mainly on the basics of R, data entry and management, descriptive statistics and graphical exploration of the data.

We did not cover basic statistical analyses, for examples t-test and chi-squared test, to focus on the basics in data exploration. By limiting the scope to data exploration, we can cover this aspect of handling data in greater details.

We also include a chapter on combining outputs for data presentation and also some packages that provide nice looking ready-made tables. To end this book, we provide more examples using a number of selected datasets, covering the data exploration skills from the preceding chapters.

All in all, we hope you enjoy this book!
